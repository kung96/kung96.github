                  <h2>DUBAI</h2>
                   <p>Dubai is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf, 
                      it is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country. Dubai is a global city and 
                      business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate 
                      the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub, but Dubai's oil reserves are limited and production levels are 
                      low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil. A growing centre for regional and international trade since the early
                      20th century, Dubai's economy today relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.</p>

                   <h2>JAPAN</h2>
                    <p>Japan is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian continent and stretches
                       from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea in the south. The kanji that make up Japan's name mean 
                       "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun". Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago consisting of about 6,852 islands.
                       The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area and often are 
                       referred to as home islands. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions, with Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture
                       and Okinawa being the southernmost one. The population of 127 million is the world's tenth largest, of which 98.5% are ethnic Japanese. 
                       90.7% of people live in cities, while 9.3% live in the countryside. About 13.8 million people live in Tokyo, the capital of Japan. 
                       The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world with over 38 million people.</p>

                       southwest of the country being home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior 
                       consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the 
                       lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. 
                       Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.</p>

                   <h2>KOREA</h2>
                    <p>Korea is a region in East Asia. Since 1948, it has been divided between two distinct sovereign states: North Korea and South Korea. Korea 
                       consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. Korea is bordered by China to the northwest,
                       Russia to the northeast, and neighbours Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Korea emerged as a singular
                       political entity in 676 AD, after centuries of conflict among the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which were unified as Unified Silla to the south 
                       and Balhae to the north. Unified Silla divided into three separate states during the Later Three Kingdoms period. Goryeo, which had succeeded
                       Goguryeo, defeated the two other states and united the Korean Peninsula as one single state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its 
                       last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. </p>
